# Game Rule


  You play on a three by three game board. you need to get three in a row to be a winner! The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game ( a tie), note that you can not click on a spot that is already taken.
